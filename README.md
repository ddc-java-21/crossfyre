[//]: # (DONE Provide project name.)

CrossFyre is a crossword-puzzle generator app for Android that allows users to work on a daily generated cross-word puzzle of a specific day. Its hallmark feature is its randomly generated puzzle that creates a unique puzzle every day. It uses a couple public API’s to retrieve words and definitions to serve as the answer banks for the puzzles. By having a login system, it allows users to leave and comeback to play a puzzle whenever they feel like it. So whether they’re looking for a brain-teaser with their morning coffee or feeling like expanding their vocabulary, CrossFyre is anyone’s go-to source for some puzzle-solving entertainment.
