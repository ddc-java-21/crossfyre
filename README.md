# CrossFyre: A competitive crossword game for Android
<br>

[//]: # (DONE Provide project name.)

## CrossFyre is a multiplayer crossword-puzzle app for Android that allows users to create new crosswords based on a small number of provided themes and work on them together over a network. Its hallmark feature is a crossword generator that creates unique puzzles in a select theme that can be changed based on user preference. It uses a public API (or APIs) to retrieve content to serve as the content for the puzzles, allowing for unique puzzles to be created every time the app is used. It allows for multiple users to play a puzzle at once using a server, and tracks user puzzle history using an account login system. So whether looking for a relaxing companion to a morning coffee, or feeling like a fun and exciting game to play with friends, this app is anyone's go-to source for never-ending puzzle-solving madness.
